                            <p> With design research, designs are more meaningful and effective because they are grounded in a real-world context. My intention is to put this analysis together in a clean, cohesive manner that provides cohesiveness, alignment and shared understanding with my team.

                            <p> Content strategy is about planning and strategizing for useful and usable content. Through the analysis, prioritization and strategization of content, it will be easier to create better user experiences. </p>

                            <h3>Prototyping</h3>
                            <p>Sketching, wireframing and prototyping process, through sketching and wireframing, and creating prototypes is a cost effective way to investigate and solve minor nuiances with the app, and allow for YUGE improvements without the need for expensive programming. This saves time, money, and headache having to go back making changes that could have been solved during the design process.</p>

Incorporating images and forms with the purpose of improving communication and usability can make a big impact on the usability ad functionality of your product. Color, typography, shapes and images are the visual tools I use to improve user experience and usability.

Title: Our customers can't live without us

Omnifood is just awesome! I just launched a startup which leaves me with no time for cooking, so Omnifood is a life-saver. Now that I got used to it, I couldn't live without my daily meals!
(Alberto Duncan)

Inexpensive, healthy and great-tasting meals, delivered right to my home. We have lots of food delivery here in Lisbon, but no one comes even close to Omifood. Me and my family are so in love!
(Joana Silva)

I was looking for a quick and easy food delivery service in San Franciso. I tried a lot of them and ended up with Omnifood. Best food delivery service in the Bay Area. Keep up the great work!
